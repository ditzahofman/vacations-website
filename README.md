# Vacations
This repository contains the source code for a Vacation website. The website allows users to search and filter vacations based on categories. It is built using a responsive design and utilizes Node.js as the server-side language and React as the client-side language to provide an interactive user experience.

The website has three main entities: Admin, Guest, and Registered User. The admin has full management rights and can control vacations, users, and other data within the system. Guests are redirected to the registration page and cannot view vacations or perform searches. Registered users have various options such as browsing vacations, saving favorites, and viewing vacation details.

The website uses a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval. It is deployed using Docker, which provides a containerized application for easy deployment and management.
